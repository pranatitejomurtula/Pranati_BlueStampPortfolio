# BlueStamp PyPortal Titano Weather Station
The PyPortal Titano Retro Weather Station displays the local temperature, weather conditions, time, and date. It also contains a customizable alarm system, with multiple daily and weekly alarms. Packed in a cool 3-D printed case, the Retro Weather Station looks like a small television.

# Final Milestone

For my final milestone, I attached a 3-D printed case to my PyPortal setup. One struggle I had was that the case arrived, but no screws to fasten the case to the screen. I ended up using strings to tie the parts together, and it worked. This last milestone was the last aesthetic touch 
to my project. Moving forward, I am interested in exploring what I can connect this project to using the I2C connection. I have either the option of connecting another PyPortal or even an Arduino to the existing PyPortal. 


# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, I customized the display and sounds of the alarm system of the project. When an alarm comes, a custom image screen drawn by me appears, and an audio of my choice plays instead of the default robot. I faced the error that although my file types for the audio files matched the original ones, the sounds were not playing. After some research, I found that the only way to make custom WAV files play on the device is to convert them from MP3 to WAV file types using Audacity. Using the following tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/microcontroller-compatible-audio-file-conversion I was able to resolve this issue and make my audios play without any errors.  


# First Milestone

My first milestone was assembling my baseline project and troubleshooting any errors I faced. I downloaded all of the files correctly, but repeatedly recieved an error in one of my code files. This code file was one of the files that came with the project bundle, so it did not make sense that there was an error in its code. After a few days of trying to fix the error, we realized that the device was not started up correctly. Following the steps to reboot the device fixed everything, and it magically began to work. In my next milestone, I want to make a second screen which can be switched to with the click of a button. This screen would display weekly alarms and their times.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
